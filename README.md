# T's ATM ðŸ’¸

This is a simple ATM program I made while learning Python. It's all about using `if`, `else`, and loops to build a working menu system. You can check your balance, deposit money, take money out, or just exit. It also asks for a PIN before letting you in.

## What it does

- Asks you for a PIN (42069)
- Only gives you 3 tries to get it right
- Shows you a menu after logging in:
  - Check balance
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Exit
- You can keep using it until you choose to leave

## Why I made this

Iâ€™m learning Python and wanted something that helps drill `if/else` and loops. This one felt just hard enough to really get the basics down without being too much.

## How to run it

1. Open the file in VS Code (or whatever editor you're using)
2. Hit the green play button in the top right
3. Use the terminal to type in your PIN and follow the menu

## Stuff I might add later

- Saving balance between runs
- Input checks so it doesnâ€™t crash on bad input
- Maybe even multiple user accounts
